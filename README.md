## The goal was just to learn to use the Stripe API.
### I ended up:
* Learning **Golang** (Fiber)
* Wasting time with **CSS** ðŸ¥¹
* Loving **Svelte** (I've done some React)
* Thinking about **CORS** a lot
* Learning **SQL** (Postgres) and not understanding the value of **ORM**s (You still have to learn the "language" that is specific to the ORM you choose.)
* Confirming that Web Design isn't my thing. Function over form.

The backend code is here: https://github.com/thirstysquirtle/coding-bum-BE  
My next project will be using a BaaS. ðŸ˜ˆ
